"""Tiny dedicated helpers for timeline edit ops.

Each operation lives in its own module so the giant
interactive_timeline.py only delegates and stays slim.

Helpers take the InteractiveFunscriptTimeline as `tl` so they can
read selection, mutate the action list, push undo, and trigger refresh
through the same channels the legacy in-class methods used.
